How often are fish misidentified/mislabelled? What are some plausible reasons 
for misidentification/mislabelling
```{r}
# Graph 1: Common Name Matches Exactly with Blasted Common Name 
# 
# Summary(class_data) # 57 total samples 
# Adding New column whose values state whether common Name == Blasted Name
new_data <- class_data %>% 
  mutate(correctly_labelled = 
           case_when(toupper(`Sample was labelled`) ==
                      toupper(`Common name (BLAST match)`)~"Yes",
                     toupper(`Sample was labelled`) !=
                      toupper(`Common name (BLAST match)`)~"No")) %>% 
  group_by(correctly_labelled) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=n, x=correctly_labelled)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(title = "Number of Samples Labelled Correctly Verified By Barcoding", x=
         "Was the Fish Labelled Correctly?", y= "Number of Sample") + theme_classic()

What are the frequencies of the IUCN categories and what does this suggest about 
the sustainability of the Toronto fish trade?  
```{r}
class_data %>% 
  mutate(status = toupper(`IUCN status`)) %>% 
  group_by(status) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=n, x= status)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = 
  "IUCN Status of Sampled Fish Species", x = "IUCN Category", y = "Number of 
  Samples") + theme_classic()
  

```
